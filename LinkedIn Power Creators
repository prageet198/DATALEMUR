Question:-
The LinkedIn Creator team is looking for power creators who use their personal profile as a company or influencer page. 
This means that if someone's Linkedin page has more followers than all the company they work for, we can safely assume that person is a Power Creator. 
Keep in mind that if a person works at multiple companies, we should take into account the company with the most followers.

Write a query to return the IDs of these LinkedIn power creators in ascending order.

Assumptions:

    A person can work at multiple companies.
    In the case of multiple companies, use the one with largest follower base.
Solution:-
WITH companyData AS (
SELECT 
employee_company.personal_profile_id,
MAX(company_pages.followers) AS companyFollowers
FROM employee_company INNER JOIN company_pages 
ON employee_company.company_id=company_pages.company_id
GROUP BY employee_company.personal_profile_id
),
filters AS (
SELECT personal_profiles.profile_id,
personal_profiles.followers,
companyFollowers,
CASE WHEN personal_profiles.followers>companyFollowers THEN 1 END AS flag
FROM companyData INNER JOIN personal_profiles 
ON companyData.personal_profile_id=personal_profiles.profile_id
)
SELECT profile_id
FROM filters WHERE flag=1
