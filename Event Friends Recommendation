Question:-
Facebook wants to recommend new friends to people who show interest in attending 2 or more of the same private events.

Sort your results in order of user_a_id and user_b_id (refer to the Example Output below).

Notes:

    A user interested in attending would have either 'going' or 'maybe' as their attendance status.
    Friend recommendations are unidirectional, meaning if user x and user y should be recommended to each other, the result table 
	should have both user x recommended to user y and user y recommended to user x.
    The result should not contain duplicates (i.e., user y should not be recommended to user x multiple times).

Solution
--1.Firstly find the users who are interested in attending private events
--2. After that self join those to get the users with same events

WITH filterCondition AS (
SELECT user_id, event_id
FROM event_rsvp
WHERE attendance_status IN ('going', 'maybe')
  AND event_type = 'private'
),
similarEventsDetail AS (
SELECT filter1.user_id AS user1id,
filter1.event_id AS user1EventId,
filter2.user_id AS user2id,
filter2.event_id AS user2EventId
FROM filterCondition AS filter1 
INNER JOIN filterCondition AS filter2
ON filter1.user_id!=filter2.user_id AND
filter1.event_id=filter2.event_id
)
SELECT friendship_status.user_a_id,
friendship_status.user_b_id
FROM similarEventsDetail INNER JOIN friendship_status 
ON similarEventsDetail.user1id=friendship_status.user_a_id
AND similarEventsDetail.user2id=friendship_status.user_b_id
WHERE friendship_status.status='not_friends'
GROUP BY friendship_status.user_a_id, friendship_status.user_b_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>=2
