Question:-
Apple has a trade-in program where their customers can return the old iPhone device to Apple and Apple gives the customers the trade-in value 
(known as payout) of the device in cash.

For each store, write a query of the total revenue from the trade-in. Order the result by the descending order.

Solution:-
SELECT store_id,
SUM(payout_amount) AS payout_total
FROM trade_in_transactions INNER JOIN trade_in_payouts 
ON trade_in_transactions.model_id=trade_in_payouts.model_id
GROUP BY store_id
ORDER BY payout_total DESC
