),
yearSequence AS (
SELECT
user_id,
filledYear,
LEAD(filledyear, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY filledyear) AS next_year,
LEAD(filledyear, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY filledyear) AS year_after_next
FROM overallData
)

SELECT

FROM yearSequence
WHERE next_year=filledYear+1 AND year_after_next=filledYear+2
