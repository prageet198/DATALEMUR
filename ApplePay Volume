Question:-
Visa is analysing its partnership with ApplyPay. Calculate the total transaction volume for each merchant where the transaction was performed via ApplePay.

Output the merchant ID and the total transactions. For merchants with no ApplePay transactions, output their total transaction volume as 0. 
Display the result in descending order of the transaction volume.

Tip: You might want to check the spelling of the payment methods... just sayin'

Solution-1:-
WITH initalTransaction AS (
SELECT merchant_id,
CASE WHEN LOWER(payment_method)='apple pay' THEN transaction_amount
ELSE 0 END AS flagAmt
FROM transactions
ORDER BY merchant_id
)

SELECT merchant_id,
SUM(flagAmt) AS totalTransaction
FROM initalTransaction
GROUP BY merchant_id
ORDER BY totalTransaction DESC

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
  merchant_id, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(payment_method) = 'apple pay' THEN transaction_amount
  ELSE 0 END) AS total_transaction
FROM transactions
GROUP BY merchant_id
ORDER BY total_transaction DESC;
