Question:-
As a data analyst on the Oracle Sales Operations team, you are given a list of salespeopleâ€™s deals, and the annual quota they need to hit.

Write a query that outputs each employee id and whether they hit the quota or not ('yes' or 'no'). Order the results by employee id in ascending order.

Definitions:

    deal_size: Deals acquired by a salesperson in the year. Each salesperson may have more than 1 deal.
    quota: Total annual quota for each salesperson.


Solution:-
SELECT deals.employee_id,
CASE WHEN SUM(deal_size)>=quota THEN 'yes' ELSE 'no' END AS made_quota
FROM deals INNER JOIN sales_quotas 
ON deals.employee_id=sales_quotas.employee_id
GROUP BY deals.employee_id, quota
ORDER BY deals.employee_id
