Question:-
When accessing Accenture's retailer client's database, you observe that the category column in products table contains null values.

Write a query that returns the updated product table with all the category values filled in, taking into consideration the assumption that the 
first product in each category will always have a defined category value.

Assumptions:

    Each category is expected to be listed only once in the column and products within the same category should be grouped together based on sequential product IDs.
    The first product in each category will always have a defined category value.
        For instance, the category for product ID 1 is 'Shoes', then the subsequent product IDs 2 and 3 will be categorised as 'Shoes'.
        Similarly, product ID 4 is 'Jeans', then the following product ID 5 is categorised as 'Jeans' category, and so forth.

Solution:-
WITH filled_category AS (
SELECT
  *,
  COUNT(category) OVER (
    ORDER BY product_id) AS numbered_category
FROM products
)

SELECT
  product_id,
  COALESCE(
    category, 
    MAX(category) OVER (PARTITION BY numbered_category)) AS category,
  name
FROM filled_category;

NOTE:-The COUNT() function calculates the number of rows with non-null values in the category column 
and the window function allows us to apply it to the entire result set.
