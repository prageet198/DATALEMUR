Question:-
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for 
their health care needs â€“ whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, 
or member portal services.

To analyze the performance of the program, write a query to determine the month-over-month growth rate specifically for long-calls. A long-call 
is defined as any call lasting more than 5 minutes (300 seconds).

Output the year and month in numerical format and chronological order, along with the growth percentage rounded to 1 decimal place.

Solution-1:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT policy_holder_id,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM DATE(call_date)) AS extractedYear,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DATE(call_date)) AS extractedMonth
FROM callers
WHERE call_duration_secs>300
),
overallData AS (
SELECT extractedYear,
extractedMonth,
COUNT(*) AS totalCalls
FROM combineData
GROUP BY extractedYear,extractedMonth
)
SELECT extractedYear,
extractedMonth,
CASE WHEN totalCalls=0 THEN 0.0 ELSE
ROUND(((totalCalls*1.0-LAG(totalCalls,1) OVER(ORDER BY extractedYear,extractedMonth))/LAG(totalCalls,1) OVER(ORDER BY extractedYear,extractedMonth))*100,1) END
AS long_calls_growth_pct
FROM overallData

Solution-2:-
WITH long_calls AS (
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM call_date) AS yr,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM call_date) AS mth,
    COUNT(case_id) AS curr_mth_calls,
    LAG(COUNT(case_id)) OVER (
      ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM call_date)) AS prev_mth_calls
FROM callers
WHERE call_duration_secs > 300
GROUP BY 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM call_date),
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM call_date)
)

SELECT
  yr,
  mth,
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    (curr_mth_calls - prev_mth_calls)/prev_mth_calls,1) AS long_calls_growth_pct
FROM long_calls
ORDER BY yr, mth;
