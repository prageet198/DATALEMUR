Question:-
Assume you are given the table below containing the information on the searches attempted and the percentage of invalid searches by country. 
Write a query to obtain the percentage of invalid searches.

Output the country in ascending order, total searches and overall percentage of invalid searches rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

    num_search = Number of searches attempted; invalid_result_pct = Percentage of invalid searches.
    In cases where countries have search attempts but do not have a percentage of invalid searches in invalid_result_pct, it should be excluded, and vice versa.
    To find the percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100 to avoid integer division.

Solution-1:-
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT country,
num_search,
ROUND((num_search*invalid_result_pct)/100) AS invalidSearch
FROM search_category 
WHERE  invalid_result_pct IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT country,
SUM(num_search) AS total_search,
ROUND((SUM(invalidSearch)/SUM(num_search))*100.0,2) AS invalid_searches_pct
FROM cte1
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
  country,
  SUM(num_search) AS total_searches,
  ROUND(SUM(num_search * invalid_result_pct)/SUM(num_search),2) AS invalid_searches_pct
FROM search_category
WHERE invalid_result_pct IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country;
