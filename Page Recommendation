Question:-
Write a query to recommend a page to a user. A recommendation is based on a page liked by user friends. Assume you have two tables: 
a two-column table of users and their friends, and a two-column table of users and the pages they liked.

Assumptions:

    Only recommend the top page to the user, and do not recommend pages that were already liked by the user.
    Top page is defined as the page with the highest number of followers.

Output the user id and page recommended. Order the result in ascending order by user id.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
  SELECT user_id, friend_id
  FROM friendship
  UNION
  SELECT friend_id, user_id
  FROM friendship
  
), recommended_pages AS (
  SELECT
    friends.user_id,
    pages.page_id,
    COUNT(*) AS followers
  FROM combineData AS friends
  LEFT JOIN page_following AS pages
    ON friends.friend_id = pages.user_id
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT id
    FROM page_following AS pages_2
    WHERE friends.user_id = pages_2.user_id
      AND pages.page_id = pages_2.page_id)
  GROUP BY friends.user_id, pages.page_id
  
), top_pages AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    page_id,
    followers,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY followers DESC) AS rnk
  FROM recommended_pages)

SELECT user_id, page_id
FROM top_pages
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY user_id;
