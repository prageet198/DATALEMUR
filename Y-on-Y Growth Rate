Question:-
Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. Write a query to calculate 
the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.

The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend 
and year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Solution:-
WITH completeData AS (
SELECT product_id,
SUM(spend) AS totalSpend,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS transactionYear
FROM user_transactions
GROUP BY product_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date)
ORDER BY product_id
),
calculation AS (
SELECT product_id,
totalSpend,
transactionYear,
LAG(totalSpend,1) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY transactionyear)
AS lastYearAmt
FROM completeData
)

SELECT transactionYear,
product_id,
totalSpend AS curr_year_spend,
lastYearAmt AS prev_year_spend,
ROUND(((totalSpend-lastYearAmt)/lastYearAmt)*100,2) AS yoy_rate
FROM calculation
