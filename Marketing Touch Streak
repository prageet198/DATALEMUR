Question:-
As a Data Analyst on Snowflake's Marketing Analytics team, your objective is to analyze customer relationship management (CRM) data 
and identify contacts that satisfy two conditions:

    Contacts who had a marketing touch for three or more consecutive weeks.
    Contacts who had at least one marketing touch of the type 'trial_request'.

Marketing touches, also known as touch points, represent the interactions or points of contact between a brand and its customers.

Your goal is to generate a list of email addresses for these contacts.

Solution:-
WITH overallData AS (
SELECT contact_id,
event_date,
EXTRACT(week FROM event_date) AS weekNumber
FROM marketing_touches
ORDER BY contact_id, event_date
),
filterCondition AS (
SELECT 
contact_id,
weekNumber,
LEAD(weekNumber, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY contact_id ORDER BY event_date) AS next_week,
LEAD(weekNumber, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY contact_id ORDER BY event_date) AS week_after_next
FROM overallData
),
firstConditionFilter AS (
SELECT DISTINCT(contact_id)
FROM filterCondition
WHERE next_week=weekNumber+1 AND week_after_next=weekNumber+2
),
secondConditionFilter AS (
SELECT DISTINCT(contact_id) AS contactId FROM marketing_touches 
WHERE contact_id IN (SELECT * FROM firstConditionFilter)
AND event_type='trial_request'
)

SELECT email FROM crm_contacts 
WHERE contact_id IN (SELECT * FROM secondConditionFilter)
