Question:-
The Apple retention team needs your help to investigate buying patterns. Write a query to determine the percentage of buyers who bought AirPods 
directly after they bought iPhones. Round your answer to a percentage (i.e. 20 for 20%, 50 for 50) with no decimals.

Clarifications:

    The users were interested in buying iPhones and then AirPods, with no intermediate purchases in between.
    Users who buy iPhones and AirPods at the same time, with the iPhone logged first, can still be counted.

Tip:

    Multiply by 100 before you perform the rounding to make sure you get the same answer we did :)

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT customer_id,
product_name,
LAG(product_name,1) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id 
ORDER BY transaction_timestamp, transaction_id) AS previousProduct
FROM transactions 
),
filters AS (
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS totalBuyCustomer
FROM combineData
WHERE previousProduct='iPhone' AND product_name='AirPods'
)
SELECT ROUND(((1.0 * totalBuyCustomer)/
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM transactions))*100) AS follow_up_percentage
FROM filters
