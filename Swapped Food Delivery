Question:-
Zomato is a leading online food delivery service that connects users with various restaurants and cuisines, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, 
and get meals delivered to their doorsteps.

Recently, Zomato encountered an issue with their delivery system. Due to an error in the delivery driver instructions, 
each item's order was swapped with the item in the subsequent row. As a data analyst, you're asked to correct this swapping error 
and return the proper pairing of order ID and item.

If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, 
if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it should remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.

In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs and items.

Solution:-
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN order_id % 2 != 0 AND order_id != total_orders THEN order_id + 1
    WHEN order_id % 2 != 0 AND order_id = total_orders THEN order_id
    ELSE order_id - 1
  END AS corrected_order_id,
  item
FROM 
  orders,
  (SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders FROM orders) AS order_counts
ORDER BY corrected_order_id;
