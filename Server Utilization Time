Question:-
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimize server usage.

Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.

Assumptions:

    Each server might start and stop several times.
    The total time in which the server fleet is running can be calculated as the sum of each server's uptime.

Solution:-
WITH completeData AS (
SELECT server_id,
session_status,
status_time,
LAG(status_time,1) OVER(PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY status_time)
AS previousTime
FROM server_utilization 
),
calculation AS (
SELECT 
SUM(ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (status_time::timestamp - previousTime::timestamp)) / 3600)) AS total_hours
FROM completeData
WHERE session_status='stop'
)

SELECT FLOOR(total_hours / 24) AS total_uptime_days FROM calculation
