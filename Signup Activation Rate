Question:-
New TikTok users sign up with their emails. They confirmed their signup by replying to the text confirmation to activate their accounts. 
Users may receive multiple text messages for account confirmation until they have confirmed their new account.

A senior analyst is interested to know the activation rate of specified users in the emails table. Write a query to find the activation rate. 
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.

Definitions:

    emails table contain the information of user signup details.
    texts table contains the users' activation information.

Assumptions:

    The analyst is interested in the activation rate of specific users in the emails table, which may not include all users that could potentially 
	be found in the texts table.
    For example, user 123 in the emails table may not be in the texts table and vice versa.

Solution-1:-
WITH latestStatus AS (
SELECT 
texts.email_id,
MAX(texts.text_id) AS latestId
FROM  texts 
GROUP BY texts.email_id
),
filterData AS (
SELECT texts.email_id,
texts.signup_action
FROM latestStatus INNER JOIN texts 
ON latestStatus.email_id=texts.email_id AND 
latestStatus.latestId=texts.text_id
),
totalData AS (
SELECT 
COUNT(CASE WHEN signup_action='Confirmed' THEN 1 END) AS totalConfirmed,
COUNT(CASE WHEN signup_action IS NULL OR signup_action='Not Confirmed' THEN 1 END) AS totalNotConfirmed
FROM emails LEFT JOIN filterData
ON emails.email_id=filterData.email_id
)
SELECT ROUND(totalConfirmed::NUMERIC/(totalConfirmed+totalNotConfirmed),2) AS confirm_rate
FROM totalData

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
  ROUND(COUNT(texts.email_id)::DECIMAL
    /COUNT(DISTINCT emails.email_id),2) AS activation_rate
FROM emails
LEFT JOIN texts
  ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id
  AND texts.signup_action = 'Confirmed';
