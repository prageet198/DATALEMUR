Question:-
As a data analyst at Uber, it's your job to report the latest metrics for specific groups of Uber users. Some riders create their Uber account the same 
day they book their first ride; the rider engagement team calls them "in-the-moment" users.

Uber wants to know the average delay between the day of user sign-up and the day of their 2nd ride. Write a query to pull the average 2nd ride 
delay for "in-the-moment" Uber users. Round the answer to 2-decimal places.

Solution:-
WITH cte AS(
SELECT user_id,
ride_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY ride_date) AS ranked,
LAG(ride_date,1,ride_date) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY ride_date)
AS previousDate
FROM rides
WHERE rides.user_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT(users.user_id) AS uid
FROM users INNER JOIN rides
ON users.registration_date=rides.ride_date AND users.user_id=rides.user_id)
)
SELECT
ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(day FROM AGE(ride_date, previousDate))),2)AS day_difference
FROM cte 
WHERE ranked=2
