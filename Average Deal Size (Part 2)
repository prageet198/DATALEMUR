Question:-
Assuming Salesforce operates on a per user (per seat) pricing model, we have a table containing contracts data.

Write a query to calculate the average annual revenue per Salesforce customer in three market segments: SMB, Mid-Market, and Enterprise. 
Each customer is represented by a single contract. Format the output to match the structure shown in the Example Output section below.

Assumptions:

    Yearly seat cost refers to the cost per seat.
    Each customer is represented by one contract.
    The market segments are categorized as:-
        SMB (less than 100 employees)
        Mid-Market (100 to 999 employees)
        Enterprise (1000 employees or more)
    The terms "average deal size" and "average revenue" refer to the same concept which is the average annual revenue generated per customer in each market segment.
	
Solution-1:-
WITH smb AS (
SELECT 
(SUM(num_seats) * contracts.yearly_seat_cost/
COUNT(DISTINCT contracts.customer_id)) AS smb_avg_revenue
FROM contracts INNER JOIN customers
ON contracts.customer_id=customers.customer_id
WHERE customers.employee_count<100
GROUP BY contracts.yearly_seat_cost
),
mid AS (
SELECT 
(SUM(num_seats) * contracts.yearly_seat_cost/
COUNT(DISTINCT contracts.customer_id)) AS mid_avg_revenue
FROM contracts INNER JOIN customers
ON contracts.customer_id=customers.customer_id
WHERE customers.employee_count>=100 AND customers.employee_count<=999
GROUP BY contracts.yearly_seat_cost
),
enterprise AS (
SELECT 
(SUM(num_seats) * contracts.yearly_seat_cost/
COUNT(DISTINCT contracts.customer_id)) AS enterprise_avg_revenue
FROM contracts INNER JOIN customers
ON contracts.customer_id=customers.customer_id
WHERE customers.employee_count>=1000
GROUP BY contracts.yearly_seat_cost
)
SELECT *
FROM smb,mid,enterprise

Solution-2:-
WITH segment_cte AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    CASE
      WHEN employee_count < 100 THEN 'smb'
      WHEN employee_count BETWEEN 100 AND 999 THEN 'mid'
      ELSE 'enterprise'
    END AS segment
  FROM customers
)
, revenue_cte AS (
  SELECT
    seg.segment,
    SUM(contracts.num_seats * contracts.yearly_seat_cost) 
      / COUNT(DISTINCT seg.customer_id) AS avg_revenue
  FROM segment_cte AS seg
  INNER JOIN contracts 
    ON seg.customer_id = contracts.customer_id
  GROUP BY seg.segment
)

SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN segment = 'smb' THEN avg_revenue END) AS smb_avg_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN segment = 'mid' THEN avg_revenue END) AS mid_avg_revenue,
  SUM(CASE WHEN segment = 'enterprise' THEN avg_revenue END) AS enterprise_avg_revenue
FROM revenue_cte;
