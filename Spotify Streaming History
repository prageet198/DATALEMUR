Question:-
You're given two tables containing data on Spotify users' streaming activity: songs_history which has historical streaming data, and songs_weekly 
which has data from the current week.

Write a query that outputs the user ID, song ID, and cumulative count of song plays up to August 4th, 2022, sorted in descending order.

Assume that there may be new users or songs in the songs_weekly table that are not present in the songs_history table.

Definitions:

    song_weeklytable only contains data for the week of August 1st to August 7th, 2022.
    songs_history table contains data up to July 31st, 2022. The query should include historical data from this table.


Solution:-
WITH historyData AS(
SELECT user_id,
song_id,
SUM(song_plays) AS totalPlayed
FROM songs_history 
GROUP BY user_id,song_id
),
weeklyData AS (
SELECT user_id,
song_id,
COUNT(*) AS totalPlay
FROM songs_weekly 
WHERE DATE(listen_time)<='08/04/2022'
GROUP BY user_id,song_id
)

SELECT user_id, song_id, SUM(totalPlayed) AS totals
FROM(SELECT * FROM historyData
              UNION ALL
              SELECT * FROM weeklyData) AS A
GROUP BY user_id, song_id
ORDER BY totals DESC
