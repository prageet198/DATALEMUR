Question:-
A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.

What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.

Assumption:

    The caller_id in phone_info table refers to both the caller and receiver.


Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT phone_calls.caller_id, p1.country_id AS callerCountry,
phone_calls.receiver_id,p2.country_id AS receiverContry
FROM phone_calls INNER JOIN phone_info AS p1
ON phone_calls.caller_id=p1.caller_id
INNER JOIN phone_info AS p2
ON phone_calls.receiver_id=p2.caller_id
),
calculation AS (
SELECT 
SUM(CASE WHEN callerCountry!=receiverContry THEN 1 END) AS toatlInternational,
SUM(CASE WHEN callerCountry=receiverContry THEN 1 END) AS totalNational
FROM combineData
)

SELECT
ROUND(((toatlInternational*1.0)/(toatlInternational+totalNational))*100,1) AS international_calls_pct
FROM calculation
