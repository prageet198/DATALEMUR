Question:-
As a Data Analyst on Snowflake's Marketing Analytics team, you're analyzing the CRM to determine what percent of marketing touches were of type "webinar" 
in April 2022. Round your percentage to the nearest integer.

Did you know? Marketing touches, also known as touch points are the brand's (Snowflake's) point of contact with the customers, from start to finish.


Solution:-
WITH toatlEvents AS(
SELECT COUNT(*) AS overallEvents
FROM marketing_touches 
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date)='2022' 
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date)='4'
),
onlyWebnair AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS onlyEvent
FROM marketing_touches 
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date)='2022' 
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date)='4'
AND event_type='webinar'
)
SELECT ROUND((onlyEvent::NUMERIC/overallEvents)*100) AS webinar_pct
FROM toatlEvents,onlyWebnair

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
  ROUND(100 *
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type='webinar' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
    COUNT(*)) as webinar_pct
FROM marketing_touches
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', event_date) = '04/01/2022';
