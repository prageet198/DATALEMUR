Question:-
You are trying to find the median number of items bought per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal point.

However, instead of doing analytics on all Alibaba orders, you have access to a summary table, which describes how many items were in an order, 
and the number of orders that had that many items.

Solution:-
WITH running_orders AS (
SELECT
  *,
  SUM(order_occurrences) OVER (
    ORDER BY item_count ASC) as running_sum,
  SUM(order_occurrences) OVER () AS total_sum
FROM items_per_order
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(item_count),1) AS median
FROM running_orders
WHERE total_sum <= 2 * running_sum
  AND total_sum >= 2 * (running_sum - order_occurrences);
