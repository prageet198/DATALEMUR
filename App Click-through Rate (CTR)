Question:-
Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the 
results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:

    Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
    To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

Solution:-
SELECT app_id,
ROUND(((COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type='click' THEN 1 END))*100.0/
COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type='impression' THEN 1 END)),2) AS ctr
FROM events
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp)='2022'
GROUP BY app_id
