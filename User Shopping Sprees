Question:-
In an effort to identify high-value customers, Amazon asked for your help to obtain data about users who go on shopping sprees. 
A shopping spree occurs when a user makes purchases on 3 or more consecutive days.

List the user IDs who have gone on at least 1 shopping spree in ascending order.

Solution:-
WITH cte AS (
SELECT user_id,
transaction_date,
LAG(transaction_date, 1, transaction_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS prev_transaction_date,
DATE_PART('day', transaction_date - LAG(transaction_date,1 ,transaction_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date)) AS day_diff
FROM transactions
),
formingGroup AS (
SELECT *,
CASE WHEN day_diff<=1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS group_flag,
SUM(CASE WHEN day_diff<=1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS group_id
FROM cte
),
calculation AS (
SELECT user_id,group_id,
COUNT(*) AS totalDays
FROM formingGroup
GROUP BY user_id,group_id
)

SELECT user_id
FROM calculation
WHERE totalDays>=3
ORDER BY user_id
