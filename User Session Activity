Question:-
Assume you are given the table containing Twitter user session activities.

Write a query that ranks users according to their total session durations (in minutes) in descending order for each session 
type between the start date (2022-01-01) and the end date (2022-02-01).

Output the user ID, session type, and the ranking of the total session duration.

Solution:-
WITH user_duration AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    session_type, 
    SUM(duration) AS total_duration 
  FROM sessions 
  WHERE start_date >= '2022-01-01' 
    AND start_date <= '2022-02-01' 
  GROUP BY user_id, session_type) 

SELECT 
  user_id, 
  session_type, 
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY session_type 
    ORDER BY total_duration DESC) AS ranking 
FROM user_duration 
ORDER BY session_type, ranking;
