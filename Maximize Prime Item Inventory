Question:-
Amazon wants to maximize the storage capacity of its 500,000 square-foot warehouse by prioritizing a specific batch of prime items. 
The specific prime product batch detailed in the inventory table must be maintained.

So, if the prime product batch specified in the item_category column included 1 laptop and 1 side table, that would be the base batch. 
We could not add another laptop without also adding a side table; they come all together as a batch set.

After prioritizing the maximum number of prime batches, any remaining square footage will be utilized to stock non-prime batches, 
which also come in batch sets and cannot be separated into individual items.

Write a query to find the maximum number of prime and non-prime batches that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse based on the following criteria:

    Prioritize stocking prime batches
    After accommodating prime items, allocate any remaining space to non-prime batches

Output the item_type with prime_eligible first followed by not_prime, along with the maximum number of batches that can be stocked.

Assumptions:

    Again, products must be stocked in batches, so we want to find the largest available quantity of prime batches, 
	and then the largest available quantity of non-prime batches
    Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.
    Item count should be whole numbers (integers).

Solution:-
--First Of All get the total capacity of Prime & Non Prime Along
-- With the total items
WITH overallData AS (
SELECT item_type,
SUM(square_footage) AS totalCapacity,
COUNT(*) AS totalItems
FROM inventory
GROUP BY item_type
),
--Now calculate the max no. of prime items
-- Max No. Of Prime Items Batches = FLOOR(Warehouse Area/Total PrimeArea)
--Max No. Of Prime Items =FLOOR(Warehouse Area/Total PrimeArea)*Total Prime Items
primeCalculation AS (
SELECT item_type,
totalCapacity,
FLOOR(500000/totalCapacity) AS primeBatchCount,
(FLOOR(500000/totalCapacity)*totalItems) AS primeItemCounts,
FLOOR(500000/totalCapacity)*totalCapacity AS totalPrimeArea
FROM overallData
WHERE item_type='prime_eligible'
),
--Now Calculate Max No Of Non- Prime Items
--Remaining Warehouse Space= Total Warehouse Area- Total Area Occupied
--By Prime Items
--Max No Of Non-Prime Batches= FLOOR ((Remaining Warehouse Space/Area Per Non Prime Batch)* No. Of Non Prime Items)
--Total Area Occupied By Prime =totalCapacity*primeBatchCount
nonPrimeCalculation AS (
SELECT item_type,
totalCapacity,
totalItems,
FLOOR(FLOOR(500000-(SELECT totalPrimeArea FROM primeCalculation))/totalCapacity)*totalItems AS nonPrimeItemCounts
FROM overallData
WHERE item_type='not_prime'
)

SELECT item_type, primeItemCounts AS item_count
FROM primeCalculation
UNION ALL
SELECT item_type, nonPrimeItemCounts
FROM nonPrimeCalculation
