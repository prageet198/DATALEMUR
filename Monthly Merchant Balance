Question:-
Say you have access to all the transactions for a given merchant account. Write a query to print the cumulative balance of the merchant account 
at the end of each day, with the total balance reset back to zero at the end of the month. Output the transaction date and cumulative balance.

Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT
CASE WHEN type='withdrawal' THEN -amount
ELSE amount END AS newAmt,
DATE(transaction_date) AS newDate
FROM transactions 
),
filterData AS (
SELECT newDate,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM newDate) AS mnt,
SUM(newAmt) AS cummulativeAmt
FROM combineData
GROUP BY newDate
ORDER BY newDate
)
SELECT newDate,
SUM(cummulativeAmt) OVER(PARTITION BY mnt ORDER BY newDate) AS balance
FROM filterData
