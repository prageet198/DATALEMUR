Question:-
In consulting, being "on the bench" means you have a gap between two client engagements. Google wants to know how many days of bench time 
each consultant had in 2021. Assume that each consultant is only staffed to one consulting engagement at a time.

Write a query to pull each employee ID and their total bench time in days during 2021.

Assumptions:

    All listed employees are current employees who were hired before 2021.
    The engagements in the consulting_engagements table are complete for the year 2022.

Solution:-

WITH calculation AS (
SELECT employee_id,
DATE_PART('day', end_date ::timestamp - start_date::timestamp)+1 AS days_difference
FROM staffing INNER JOIN consulting_engagements
ON staffing.job_id=consulting_engagements.job_id
WHERE is_consultant='true'
)

SELECT employee_id,
365-SUM(days_difference)
FROM calculation
GROUP BY employee_id
