Question:-
As a Data Analyst on the Google Maps User Generated Content team, you and your Product Manager are investigating user-generated content (UGC) â€“ 
photos and reviews that independent users upload to Google Maps.

Write a query to determine which type of place (place_category) attracts the most UGC tagged as "off-topic". In the case of a tie, 
show the output in ascending order of place_category.

Assumptions:

    Some places may not have any tags.
    Each UGC upload with the "off-topic" tag will be counted separately.


Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT place_info.place_category,
COUNT(content_id) AS totalTags
FROM maps_ugc_review INNER JOIN place_info 
ON maps_ugc_review.place_id=place_info.place_id
WHERE LOWER(content_tag)='off-topic'
GROUP BY place_info.place_category
),
ranking AS (
SELECT *,
RANK() OVER(ORDER BY totalTags DESC) AS ranked
FROM combineData
)
SELECT place_category
FROM ranking WHERE ranked='1'
