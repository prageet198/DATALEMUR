Question:-
The Airbnb marketing analytics team is trying to understand what are the most common marketing channels that lead users to book their first rental on Airbnb.

Write a query to find the top marketing channel and percentage of first rental bookings from the aforementioned marketing channel. 
Round the percentage to the closest integer. Assume there are no ties.

Assumptions:

    Marketing channel with null values should be incorporated in the percentage of first bookings calculation, but the top channel should not be a null value. 
	Meaning, we cannot have null as the top marketing channel.
    To avoid integer division, multiple the percentage with 100.0 and not 100.

Solution:-
WITH user_bookings AS (
SELECT 
  bookings.booking_id,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY bookings.user_id
    ORDER BY bookings.booking_date) AS booking_no,
  channels.channel
FROM bookings
INNER JOIN booking_attribution AS channels
  ON bookings.booking_id = channels.booking_id
), 
first_bookings AS (
SELECT 
  channel, 
  COUNT(*) AS channel_booking
FROM user_bookings
WHERE booking_no = 1
GROUP BY channel
)

SELECT 
  channel, 
  ROUND(100.0 * (channel_booking / 
    (SELECT SUM(channel_booking) FROM first_bookings)), 0) AS first_booking_pct
FROM first_bookings
WHERE channel IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY first_booking_pct DESC
LIMIT 1;
