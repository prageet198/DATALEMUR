Question:-
Assume you're given a table on Walmart user transactions. Based on their most recent transaction date, write a query that retrieve the users along 
with the number of products they bought.

Output the user's most recent transaction date, user ID, and the number of products, sorted in chronological order by the transaction date.

Solution:-
WITH userMaxDate AS (
SELECT user_id,
MAX(DATE(transaction_date)) AS maxTransDate
FROM user_transactions
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT 
user_transactions.user_id,
user_transactions.transaction_date,
COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM user_transactions INNER JOIN userMaxDate
ON user_transactions.user_id=userMaxDate.user_id AND
DATE(user_transactions.transaction_date)=maxTransDate
GROUP BY user_transactions.user_id,
user_transactions.transaction_date
ORDER BY user_transactions.transaction_date
