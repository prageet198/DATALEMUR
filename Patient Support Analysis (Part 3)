Question:-
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive 
support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, 
emergency assistance, or member portal services.

Write a query to obtain the number of unique callers who made calls within a 7-day interval of their previous calls. If a caller made more 
than two calls within the 7-day period, count them only once.

Solution-1:-
WITH call_history AS (
  SELECT
    policy_holder_id,
    call_date AS current_call, -- Remove this column
    LAG(call_date) OVER (
  	  PARTITION BY policy_holder_id ORDER BY call_date) AS previous_call, -- Remove this column
    ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM call_date 
      - LAG(call_date) OVER (
  	    PARTITION BY policy_holder_id ORDER BY call_date)
    )/(24*60*60),2) AS time_diff_days
  FROM callers
)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT policy_holder_id) AS policy holder_count
FROM call_history
WHERE time_diff_days <= 7;

Solution-2:-
WITH combineData AS (
SELECT policy_holder_id,
call_date,
DATE(call_date)-LAG(DATE(call_date),1) 
OVER(PARTITION BY policy_holder_id ORDER BY DATE(call_date)) AS daysDiff
FROM callers
ORDER BY policy_holder_id, call_date
)
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT policy_holder_id) AS policy_holder_count
FROM combineData
WHERE daysDiff BETWEEN 1 AND 7
