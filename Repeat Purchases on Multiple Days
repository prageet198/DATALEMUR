Question:-
Assume you are given the table below containing information on user purchases. Write a query to obtain the number of users who purchased 
the same product on two or more different days. Output the number of unique users.

Solution-1:-
WITH commonData AS (
SELECT user_id,
product_id,
DATE(purchase_date) AS purchasedDate
FROM purchases
),
calculation AS (
SELECT *,
purchaseddate-LAG(purchaseddate,1,purchaseddate) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, product_id
ORDER BY purchaseddate) AS dateDifff
FROM commonData
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS repeat_purchasers
FROM calculation
WHERE dateDifff>0

Solution-2:-
WITH repeat_purchases AS (
SELECT DISTINCT user_id AS users
FROM purchases
GROUP BY user_id, product_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT purchase_date::DATE) > 1
)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT users) AS repeated_purchasers
FROM repeat_purchases;

Solution-3 Using Self Join:-
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p1.user_id) AS repeated_purchasers
FROM purchases AS p1
INNER JOIN purchases AS p2
  ON p1.product_id = p2.product_id
    AND p1.purchase_date::DATE <> p2.purchase_date::DATE;
