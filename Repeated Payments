Question:-
Sometimes, payment transactions are repeated by accident; it could be due to user error, API failure or a retry error that causes a credit card to be charged twice.

Using the transactions table, identify any payments made at the same merchant with the 
same credit card for the same amount within 10 minutes of each other. Count such repeated payments.

Assumptions:

    The first transaction of such payments should not be counted as a repeated payment. This means, 
	if there are two transactions performed by a merchant with the same credit card and for the same amount within 10 minutes, there will only be 1 repeated payment.
	
Solution-1:-
WITH initialData AS (
SELECT 
merchant_id,
credit_card_id,
amount,
transaction_timestamp,
LAG(transaction_timestamp,1) OVER(PARTITION BY merchant_id
ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS previousTransTime,
LAG(credit_card_id,1) OVER(PARTITION BY merchant_id
ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS previousCard,
LAG(amount,1) OVER(PARTITION BY merchant_id
ORDER BY transaction_timestamp) AS previousAmt
FROM transactions
),
filterData AS (
SELECT 
merchant_id,
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (transaction_timestamp - previousTransTime)) / 60 AS timeDiff,
credit_card_id,
previousCard,
amount,
previousAmt
FROM initialData
)
SELECT COUNT (merchant_id) AS payment_count
FROM filterData
WHERE amount=previousAmt AND credit_card_id=previousCard
AND timeDiff<=10

Solution-2:-
WITH initialData AS (
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  merchant_id, 
  credit_card_id, 
  amount, 
  transaction_timestamp,
  LAG(transaction_timestamp) OVER (
    PARTITION BY merchant_id, credit_card_id, amount 
    ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
  ) AS previous_transaction 
FROM transactions
),
filterData AS (
SELECT transaction_id,
merchant_id,
credit_card_id,
amount,
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (transaction_timestamp - previous_transaction)) / 60 AS timeDiff
FROM initialData
)

SELECT COUNT(merchant_id) AS payment_count
FROM filterData
WHERE timeDiff<=10
