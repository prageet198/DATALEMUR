Question:-
Assume you're given a table containing Etsy user transactions. Write a query that retrieves the customers whose first transaction was valued at $50 or more. 
Output the total number of users who meet this criteria.

Instructions:

    To determine the first transaction for each user, use the transaction_date field.
    Take into account scenarios where a user had multiple transactions on the same day. Use a specific function (we can't give too much away ðŸ˜‰) 
	to handle these cases and correctly identify the first transaction.

Solution:-
WITH cte AS (
SELECT user_id,
spend,
transaction_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS ranked
FROM user_transactions 
ORDER BY user_id
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalUsers
FROM cte 
WHERE ranked=1 AND spend >=50.00
