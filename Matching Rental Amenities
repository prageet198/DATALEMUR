Question:-
The Airbnb Booking Recommendations team is trying to understand the "substitutability" of two rentals and whether one rental is a good substitute for another. 
They want you to write a query to find the unique combination of two Airbnb rentals with the same exact amenities offered.

Output the count of the unique combination of Airbnb rentals.

Assumptions:

    If property 1 has a kitchen and pool, and property 2 has a kitchen and pool too, it is a good substitute and represents a unique matching rental.
    If property 3 has a kitchen, pool and fireplace, and property 4 only has a pool and fireplace, then it is not a good substitute.

Solution:-
WITH airbnb_amenities AS (
SELECT
  rental_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(amenity ORDER BY amenity) AS amenities
FROM rental_amenities
GROUP BY rental_id)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS matching_airbnb
FROM airbnb_amenities AS airbnb1
JOIN airbnb_amenities AS airbnb2
  ON airbnb1.amenities = airbnb2.amenities
WHERE airbnb1.rental_id > airbnb2.rental_id;
