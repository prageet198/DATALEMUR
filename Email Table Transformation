Question:-
Each Facebook user can designate a personal email address, a business email address, and a recovery email address.

Unfortunately, the table is currently in the wrong format, so you need to transform its structure to show the following columns 
(see example output): user id, personal email, business email, and recovery email. Sort your answer by user id in ascending order.

Solution:-
SELECT 
    user_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN email_type = 'personal' THEN email END) AS personal_email,
    MAX(CASE WHEN email_type = 'business' THEN email END) AS business_email,
    MAX(CASE WHEN email_type = 'recovery' THEN email END) AS recovery_email
FROM 
    users 
GROUP BY 
    user_id
ORDER BY user_id
