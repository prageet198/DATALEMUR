Question:-
You are given the two tables containing information on Etsyâ€™s user signups and purchases. Write a query to obtain the percentage of users 
who signed up and made a purchase within 7 days of signing up. The result should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.

Assumptions:

    Signups who didn't buy any products yet should also count as part of the percentage of users who signed up and made a purchase within 7 days of signing up
    If the signup date is on 06/21/2022 and the purchase date on 06/26/2022, then the user makes up part of the percentage of users who signed up a
	nd purchased within the 7 days of signing up.
	
Solution:
SELECT ROUND(
  100.0 * 
    COUNT(DISTINCT purchases.user_id) / 
    COUNT(DISTINCT signups.user_id), 2) AS same_week_purchases_pct
FROM signups
LEFT JOIN user_purchases AS purchases
  ON signups.user_id = purchases.user_id
WHERE purchases.purchase_date IS NULL
  OR (purchases.purchase_date BETWEEN signups.signup_date 
  AND (signups.signup_date + '7 days'::INTERVAL));
