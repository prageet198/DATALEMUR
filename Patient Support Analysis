Question:-
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support 
for their health care needs – whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, 
or member portal services.

Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are classified into various categories, but some calls cannot be neatly categorised. These uncategorised 
calls are labeled as “n/a”, or are left empty when the support agent does not enter anything into the call category field.

Write a query to calculate the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place. For example, 45.0, 48.5, 57.7.

Solution:-
WITH unauthorized AS (
SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalUnauthorized
FROM callers
WHERE call_category IS NULL OR call_category='n/a'
)

SELECT ROUND((totalUnauthorized*1.0/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM callers))*100,1)
AS uncategorised_call_pct
FROM unauthorized
