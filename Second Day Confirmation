Question:-
Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their 
email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.

Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.

Definition:

    action_date refers to the date when users activated their accounts and confirmed their sign-up through text messages.

Solution-1:-
SELECT emails.user_id
FROM emails INNER JOIN texts
ON emails.email_id=texts.email_id
WHERE texts.signup_action='Confirmed' AND
(texts.action_date::DATE-emails.signup_date::DATE)='1'

Solution-2:-
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM emails 
INNER JOIN texts
  ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id
WHERE texts.action_date = emails.signup_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND texts.signup_action = 'Confirmed';
