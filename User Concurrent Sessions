Question:-
Assume you're given a table containing information about user sessions, including the start and end times of each session. 
Write a query to retrieve the user session(s) that occur concurrently with the other user sessions.

Output the session ID and the number of concurrent user sessions, sorted in descending order.

Assumptions:

    Concurrent sessions are defined as sessions that overlap with each other. For instance, if session 1 starts before session 2, 
	session 2's start time should fall either before or after session 1's end time.
    Sessions with identical start and end times should not be considered concurrent sessions.

Solution:-
SELECT 
  sessions_1.session_id, 
  COUNT(sessions_2.session_id) AS concurrent_sessions 
FROM sessions AS sessions_1 
INNER JOIN sessions AS sessions_2 
  ON sessions_1.session_id != sessions_2.session_id
    AND (sessions_2.start_time BETWEEN sessions_1.start_time AND sessions_1.end_time
    OR sessions_1.start_time BETWEEN sessions_2.start_time AND sessions_2.end_time)
GROUP BY sessions_1.session_id
ORDER BY concurrent_sessions DESC;
