Question:-
You're given a list of numbers representing the number of emails in the inbox of Microsoft Outlook users. Before the Product Management team can start 
developing features related to bulk-deleting email or achieving inbox zero, they simply want to find the mean, median, and mode for the emails.

Display the output of mean, median and mode (in this order), with the mean rounded to the nearest integer. It should be assumed that there are no ties for the mode.

Solution:-
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(email_count)) as mean,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY email_count) AS median,
  MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY email_count) AS mode
 FROM inbox_stats;
