Question:-
Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. 
Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:

    Calculate the following percentages:
        time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
        Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
    To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

Solution-1:-
WITH overall AS (
SELECT
age_breakdown.age_bucket,
SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type='send' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS totalSpendTime,
SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type='open' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS totalOpenTime
FROM activities INNER JOIN age_breakdown
ON activities.user_id=age_breakdown.user_id
GROUP BY age_breakdown.age_bucket
)

SELECT age_bucket,
ROUND(totalSpendTime*100.0/(totalSpendTime+totalOpenTime),2) AS send_perc,
ROUND(totalOpenTime*100.0/(totalSpendTime+totalOpenTime),2) AS open_perc
FROM overall

Solution-2:-
SELECT 
  age.age_bucket, 
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    SUM(activities.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activities.activity_type = 'send')/
    SUM(activities.time_spent),2) AS send_perc, 
  ROUND(100.0 * 
    SUM(activities.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activities.activity_type = 'open')/
    SUM(activities.time_spent),2) AS open_perc
FROM activities
INNER JOIN age_breakdown AS age 
  ON activities.user_id = age.user_id 
WHERE activities.activity_type IN ('send', 'open') 
GROUP BY age.age_bucket;
