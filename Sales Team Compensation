Question:-
As the Sales Operations Analyst at Oracle, you have been tasked with assisting the VP of Sales in determining the final compensation earned 
by each salesperson for the year. The compensation structure includes a fixed base salary, a commission based on total deals, and potential accelerators 
for exceeding their quota.

Each salesperson earns a fixed base salary and a percentage of commission on their total deals. Also, if they beat their quota, any sales 
after that receive an accelerator, which is just a higher commission rate applied to their commissions after they hit the quota.

Write a query that calculates the total compensation earned by each salesperson. The output should include the employee ID and their corresponding 
total compensation, sorted in descending order. In the case of ties, the employee IDs should be sorted in ascending order.

Assumptions:

    A salesperson is considered to have hit their target (quota) if their total deals meet or exceed the assigned quota.
    If a salesperson does not meet the target, their compensation package consists of the fixed base salary and a commission based on the total deals.
    If a salesperson meets the target, their compensation package includes
        The fixed base salary,
        A commission on target (quota), and
        An additional commission, including any accelerator on the remaining balance of the total deals (total deals - quota). The accelerator 
		represents a higher commission rate for sales made beyond the quota.

Solution:-

SELECT 
  deals.employee_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN SUM(deals.deal_size) <= employee.quota 
      THEN employee.base + (employee.commission * SUM(deals.deal_size)) -- #1
    ELSE employee.base + (employee.commission * employee.quota) + 
      ((SUM(deals.deal_size) - employee.quota) * employee.commission * employee.accelerator) -- #2
  END AS total_compensation
FROM deals
INNER JOIN employee_contract AS employee
  ON deals.employee_id = employee.employee_id
GROUP BY deals.employee_id, employee.quota, employee.base, employee.commission, employee.accelerator
ORDER BY total_compensation DESC, deals.employee_id;
