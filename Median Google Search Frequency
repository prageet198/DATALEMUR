Question:-
Google's marketing team is making a Superbowl commercial and needs a simple statistic to put on their TV ad: the median number of searches a person made last year.

However, at Google scale, querying the 2 trillion searches is too costly. Luckily, you have access to the summary table which tells you 
the number of searches made last year and how many Google users fall into that bucket.

Write a query to report the median of searches made by a user. Round the median to one decimal point.

Solution
WITH RECURSIVE NumberSequence AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1
    FROM NumberSequence
    WHERE n < (SELECT MAX(num_users) FROM search_frequency)
),
combineData AS (
SELECT s.searches
FROM search_frequency s
JOIN NumberSequence ns ON ns.n <= s.num_users
ORDER BY s.searches, ns.n
)
SELECT ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (
ORDER BY searches)::DECIMAL,1) AS median
FROM combineData
