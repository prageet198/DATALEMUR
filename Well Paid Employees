Question:-
Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees 
earning more than their direct managers.

As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

Solution:-
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT e1.employee_id,
e1.name,
e1.salary AS empSalary,
e2.salary AS managerSalary,
CASE WHEN e1.salary>e2.salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS flag
FROM employee AS e1 INNER JOIN employee AS e2
ON e1.manager_id=e2.employee_id
)
SELECT employee_id,name
FROM cte1
WHERE flag='1'
