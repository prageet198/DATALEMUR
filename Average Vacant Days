Question:-
The strategy team in Airbnb is trying to analyze the impact of Covid-19 during 2021. To do so, they need you to write a query that outputs 
the average vacant days across the AirBnbs in 2021. Some properties have gone out of business, so you should only analyze rentals that are currently active. 
Round the results to a whole number.

Assumptions:

    is_active field equals to 1 when the property is active, and 0 otherwise.
    In cases where the check-in or check-out date is in another year other than 2021, limit the calculation to the beginning or end of the year 2021 respectively.
    Listing can be active even if there are no bookings throughout the year.

Solution:-
WITH listing_vacancies AS (
SELECT 
  listings.listing_id,
  365 - COALESCE(
    SUM(
      CASE WHEN checkout_date>'12/31/2021' THEN '12/31/2021' ELSE checkout_date END -
      CASE WHEN checkin_date<'01/01/2021' THEN '01/01/2021' ELSE checkin_date END 
  ),0) AS vacant_days
FROM listings 
LEFT JOIN bookings
  ON listings.listing_id = bookings.listing_id 
WHERE listings.is_active = 1
GROUP BY listings.listing_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(vacant_days)) AS avgVacantDays
FROM listing_vacancies;
