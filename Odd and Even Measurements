Question:-
Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. 
Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:

    Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th 
	times are considered even-numbered measurements.
Solution:-
WITH combineData AS (
    SELECT
        DATE(measurement_time) AS measurement_day,
        measurement_value,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY DATE(measurement_time) ORDER BY measurement_time) AS ranked
    FROM measurements
)
SELECT
    measurement_day,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ranked % 2 != 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ranked % 2 = 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
FROM combineData
GROUP BY measurement_day;
