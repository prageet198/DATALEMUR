Question:-
The LinkedIn Creator team is seeking out individuals who have a strong influence on the platform, utilizing their personal profiles as a 
company or influencer page. To identify such power creators, we can compare the number of followers on their LinkedIn page with the number 
of followers on the company they work for. If a person's LinkedIn page has more followers than their company, we consider them to be a power creator.

Write a query to retrieve the profile IDs of these LinkedIn power creators ordered in ascending order based on their IDs.

Assumptions:

    Each individual in the database has a LinkedIn profile associated with a single company.
    The personal_profiles and company_pages tables are connected via the employer_id and company_id columns, respectively.

Solution-1:-
WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT personal_profiles.profile_id,
CASE WHEN personal_profiles.followers>company_pages.followers THEN 1
END AS flag
FROM personal_profiles INNER JOIN company_pages
ON personal_profiles.employer_id=company_pages.company_id
)
SELECT profile_id
FROM cte1
WHERE flag='1'
ORDER BY profile_id

Solution-2:-
SELECT profiles.profile_id
FROM personal_profiles AS profiles
INNER JOIN company_pages AS pages
  ON profiles.employer_id = pages.company_id
WHERE profiles.followers > pages.followers
ORDER BY profiles.profile_id;
