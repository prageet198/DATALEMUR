Question:-
The Bloomberg terminal is the go-to resource for financial professionals, offering convenient access to a wide array of financial datasets. 
As a Data Analyst at Bloomberg, you have access to historical data on stock performance for the FAANG stocks.

Your task is to analyze the inter-month change in percentage for each FAANG stock by month over the years. This involves calculating the percentage 
change in closing price from one month to the next using the following formula:

Inter-month change in percentage = (Current month's closing price - Previous month's closing price) / Previous month's closing price x 100

For each FAANG stock, display the ticker symbol, the last day of the month, closing price, and the inter-month value change in 
percentage rounded to two decimal places for each stock. Ensure that the results are sorted by ticker symbol and date in chronological order.

Solution:-
SELECT 
ticker,
date,
close,
ROUND(((close-LAG(close,1) OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date))/
LAG(close,1) OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date)) *100,2) AS intermth_change_pct
FROM stock_prices 
ORDER BY ticker, date
