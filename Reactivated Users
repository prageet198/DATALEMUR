Question:-
Imagine you're provided with a table containing information about user logins on Facebook in 2022. Write a query that determines the number of 
reactivated users for a given month. Reactivated users are those who were inactive the previous month but logged in during the current month.

Output the month in numerical format along with the count of reactivated users.

Here's some important assumptions to consider:

    The user_logins table only contains data for the year 2022 and there are no missing dates within that period.
    For instance, if a user whose first login date is on 3 March 2022, we assume that they had previously logged in during the year 2021. 
	Although the data for their previous logins is not present in the user_logins table, we consider these users as reactivated users.

Solution:-
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.login_date) AS mth, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT curr_month.user_id) AS reactivated_users
FROM user_logins AS curr_month 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM user_logins AS last_month 
  WHERE curr_month.user_id = last_month.user_id 
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM last_month.login_date) = 
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.login_date - '1 month' :: INTERVAL)
) 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.login_date)
ORDER BY mth;
